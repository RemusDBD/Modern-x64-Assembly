# Division with the DIV and IDIV Instructions

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwTYM0oSwjg) is on the DIV instruction. This instruction is used to divide unsigned integers. It is interesting because it computes not only the division, but also the remainder after division. DIV is also interesting because it (and it's signed, sister instruction IDIV) have implied input parameters, and output parameters.
