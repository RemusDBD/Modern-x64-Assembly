# Conditional Jumps, Moves and Set Byte

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsRHbXX8YJo) is on conditional instructions; conditional jumps, conditional moves and the set byte instructions. They all use the same condition codes, and so Creel tried to relate them by presenting them together. These instructions all perform certain actions (i.e. jump, or move data) based on the bits in the rFlags register. They are how we instruct the CPU to act on the flags.
