# Shift, Rotate and Bit Manipulation Instructions

In this video we'll look at 8 different bit shift instructions, SHL, SHR, ROR, ROL, RCR, RCL, SHRD and SHLD. Sry, the intro is a little loud in this one :(

This video gives examples of shifting, rotating (rotate and rotation), and bit manipulation instructions as per the x86 and x64 Assembly instruction sets. Useful for Intel and AMD desktop and Laptop computers.

We also look at some tricks or bit hacks, demonstrating fast multiplication and division, and compare and contrast these techniques with the IDIV and DIV instructions.
