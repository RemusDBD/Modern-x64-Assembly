# Control Structures (If statements, do while, while and for loops)

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5yGg3SlpZo), we'll look at control structures, and how they look in both C++ and Assembly. We will look at basic If Statements, branchless programming with CMOVxx instructions, While, Do/While and For loops. As well as a little at the regular ASM loop, which is something like a do while loop.
