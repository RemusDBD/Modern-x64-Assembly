# 32 and 64 bit Registers

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh7GQ_joeE4) we'll look at the 32 bit and 64 bit general purpose registers. There are a lot more registers in x86, but this video concludes the GPR.

Creel has also made a special mention of the fact that operations on 32 bit registers clear the top 32 bits of the 64 bit registers.
