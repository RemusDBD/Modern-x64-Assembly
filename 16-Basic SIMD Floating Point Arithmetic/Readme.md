# Basic SIMD Floating Point Arithmetic

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-dAJHRAym8), we look at the basic floating point SIMD instructions to achieve Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division. This introduction includes both double precision and single precision, and the SSE, SSE2 and AVX instruction sets. I have included both the Assembly versions of the instructions as well as the C++ compiler intrinsics.
